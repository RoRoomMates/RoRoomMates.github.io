          Finding a new place to live is challenging. Even more so if you are coming from a small town or village to a big city and you have limited resources and lack of a social network.
          Whatsapp and Facebook groups are a good place to start, but they are not tailored for every need. If you ever felt that you were not taken seriously while trying to find a roommate this is the right place to find one.
          Have you ever had roommates not to your liking? Either too messy or too demanding or just not having the right chemistry?
