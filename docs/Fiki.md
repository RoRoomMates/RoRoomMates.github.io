# The problem of finding a roommate
Finding a new place to live is challenging. Even more so if you are coming from a small town or village to a big city and you have limited resources and lack of a social network.

Whatsapp and Facebook groups are a good place to start, but they are not tailored for every need. If you ever felt that you were not taken seriously while trying to find a roommate this is the right place to find one.

Have you ever had roommates not to your liking? Either too messy or too demanding or just not having the right chemistry?

# RoomMates value proposition
An easy to use web application that offers the key resources along with an open-minded community to help you cope with the challenges of moving to a new city and starting a new way of life or just changing your current roommate.

Our solution helps you find a roommate and a place to live in a dorm at your university or in rent.

Build your RoomMate profile along with mandatory characteristics for your roommate, for example no smokers, pets allowed, must be tidy, and so on.

# Customer segment/s
Students, either bachelor, masters or even doctorates, seeking to find a new or better roommate and a place to live.

Young people at the beginning of their career.

* eproprietar.ro - a platform for finding a place to rent
* orasultau.ro - a platform for adds listing
