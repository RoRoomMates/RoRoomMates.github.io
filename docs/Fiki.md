Providing a solution to the problem of finding a place to live. Either doorms or shared apartments, RoomMates is the solution for you.

Mostly tailored for students coming from outside the city where the university is located.

Might not be limited to finding a room mate, but also features to help students cope with the difficulties of being in a new environment and being more productive with their university life.

# Every newcomer student's problem
Coming from a small town or village to a big city is challenging. Even more so if you are a student, with limited resources and / or lack of a social network.

Whatsapp and Facebook groups are a good place to start, but they are not tailored for every need.

Whatsapp groups are too narrow, they are a single channel for everything. It lacks a means of organizing based on topics, and finding what you need when you need it is often cumbersome.

Facebook is great for networking, but it's a poor place to find non-public resources. I wouldn't recommend asking too many "stupid questions" in a public forum, and also I wouldn't advertise the place where I live, be it a dorm or a rented place.

# RoomMates value proposition
An easy to use site and/or mobile app that offers the key resources along with an open-minded community to help students cope with the challenges of moving to a new city and starting a new way of life.

Our solution helps you find a room mate, be it in a dorm at your university of choice or renting a place. In case you will be staying in a dorm, you may also find our solution helpful should you need to change your room mate for whatever reason.

More than just a "Tinder for room mates", you will easily find the resources needed of your specific university in an intuitive format, unified accross all universities (that we currently support).

And to top it all off, you will find a community of students that are or have gone through the same experience as you, albe to provide feedback and guidance with whatever you are struggling.

# Customer segment/s
Primarily students, either bachelor, masters or even doctorates.

Also universities that want a better representation and a great community for their students.
