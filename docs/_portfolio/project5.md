# Who we brought to the landing page
We brought our friends, acquanintaces, and the people we interviewed, and some of their friends.
We also posted in daily story on instagram and one reddit post.

# Leading campain
We don't think we are there yet with our offering. We have analytics, and we can measure the conversion rate by how many visitors enter an email address, and how many click the Join! button.

But following the interviews we had, we might want to rethink or "soft pivot" one of the main features of our solution (reuse an idea from Tinder, and add a stronger socializing component).
So we believe a leading campain is more opportunistic in a few days, at most a week. We will do it for the next milestone.

**Note**: We did do some posts: on instagram story, reddit.
