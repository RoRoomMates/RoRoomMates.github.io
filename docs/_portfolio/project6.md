# The size of the market
Data we collected:
* [www.olx.ro](https://www.olx.ro) - over 1300 posts country wide seeking room mates
  * Over 20 recent posts in Bucharest alone
* [www.oferte360.ro](https://www.oferte360.ro/) - 50 to 100 offers
* [orasultau.ro](https://orasultau.ro/) - a couple dozen offers fairly recent adds
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) - several groups with members ranging from 1000 to almost 30 000, not easy to search and filter, you need to dig through each post

In addition, there are rougthly over 400 000 students country wide, and over 125 000 students in Bucharest alone. For Bucharest way over half of them come from outside Bucharest (70% for UPB).

For our estimate we take a conservative 50% country wide of students needing accommodations and possibly room mates, and another rough estimate of 25% of them addressable. This results in an estimate of an addressable market of `50 000` country wide, yearly.

We do not account for potential repeats, that is customers that will be seeking a room mate in the following university year, because we start from the number of students which already includes all schooling years, we are just missing those who repeat a year in university.
