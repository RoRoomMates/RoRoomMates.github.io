# The size of the market
Data we collected:
* [www.olx.ro](https://www.olx.ro) - over 1300 posts country wide seeking room mates
  * Over 20 recent posts in Bucharest alone
* [www.oferte360.ro](https://www.oferte360.ro/) - 50 to 100 offers
* [orasultau.ro](https://orasultau.ro/) - a couple dozen offers fairly recent ads
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) - several groups with members ranging from 1000 to almost 30 000, not easy to search and filter, you need to dig through each post

In addition, there are rougthly over 400 000 students country wide, and over 125 000 students in Bucharest alone. For Bucharest way over half of them come from outside Bucharest (70% for UPB).

For our estimate we take a conservative 50% country wide of students needing accommodations and possibly room mates, and another rough estimate of 25% of them addressable. This results in an estimate of an addressable market of `50 000` country wide, yearly, and about a third in Bucharest, or `17 000`.

We do not account for potential repeats, that is customers that will be seeking a room mate in the following university year, because we start from the number of students which already includes all schooling years, we are just missing those who repeat a year in university.

# The approximate number of players / competitors in your targeted market
There are no exact direct competitors in Romania, because finding good room mates is not the main focus for either of the existing competitors. 
That being said, there are about 5 more widely used applications within Romania:
* Facebook
* olx
* publi24
* eProprietar
* orasultau

Internationally, there are other platforms including some more direct competitors:
* findroommate.dk
* roomster.com
* roommates.com
* generic add listings such as craigslist and diggz

# Competitor's market share

We could not find relevant information about the market share, but here are some relevant details about the most important competitors.

## Roomster
Roomster is a trusted name for people to post & search Roommates and Rooms for rent around the world.
Their Annual Revenue is $15.0M - $25.0M. They have around 800K-1M visits per month.

## Roommates
Had to pay to find their real revenue :). They have around 300K visits per month.



## Romania - OLX
Over 1300 currently existing posts about roommates. They do not produce money directly from them because they are not really selling something, but it keeps their platform relevant and used and they show ads bringing in some revenue. They almost consistently have over 1000 fairly recently (past 2 weeks) updated ads, so we estimate about half of them to be new monthly which gives them a bit less than 1000 new users monthly which ends up to about 10 000 users yearly. Based on this estimate they own about 20% of the market.

## Romania - Bucharest Facebook groups
On the several Facebook groups, there are several tens of daily posts each. This is tricky to estimate, but we assume a rate of reposts of roughly 50%. The top several relevant Facebook groups:
* [Caut coleg(a) de apartament in Bucuresti](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cautcoleg/) - 6 posts daily
* [Caut coleg/colega de camera/apartament](https://www.facebook.com/groups/153562218116576/) - 10+ posts daily, also in Bucharest
* [Caut coleg de apartament Bucuresti](https://www.facebook.com/groups/117558924940343/) - about 5 posts daily
* [Caut Coleg(a) Apartament Bucuresti](https://www.facebook.com/groups/306649326142616/) - 3 posts daily
* [Inchireri apartamente / caut coleg/a pentru inchiriere apartament](https://www.facebook.com/groups/366200686838345/) - 2 posts daily, also in Bucharest
* [Chirii Mici in Bucuresti | Coleg de camera/apartament](https://www.facebook.com/groups/621827574647272/) - 2 posts daily, also in Bucharest
All of the above are specific to Bucharest, ar at least so they claim, and we get a total of 28+ posts daily, rounding up to 30. This means about 900 posts monthly, in Bucharest.

We apply the 50% guess of original posts to get 450 monthly new original posts and 5400 yearly. If we consider each of these to be a user and compare to the initial market size estimate based on the number of students in Bucharest consisting our target market, we get `5400` out of about `17 000` means about 31% of the market.

## Romania - other platforms such as orasultau, oferte360, publi24, okazii
We estimate each of the smaller players to have ranging from 2% to 5% market share based on the number of "fairly recent" ads related to searching for room mates.


# Our potential market share
We estimate that in Romania our market share would be in the first year around 5-10%, with a big chance to increase with up to 10% per year for years 3 to 5.

The main reason why we believe we can get such a big market share early on is that the market is not saturated, and most of the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is not even addresed directly by any competitor in Romania:
* Facebook - 31%
* olx - 20%
* other ad platforms combined - 10%

The rest of the market is probably unaccounted for in other platforms, that are more opaque, such as whatsapp groups, instagram, and others. We have heard of these platforms being used by students in a few of our interviews, so we are aware the market is heavily branched out.

By focusing on people compatibility and only facilitating the search for the tenancy we will avoid the housing and rent market mostly and focus on our target market, which is people caring about their experience of sharing their living space with someone else for either economic, financial reasons or even for fun.
