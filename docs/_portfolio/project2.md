## How we identified the problem
By help of social media and student circles we identified a high-level of dissatisfaction among students regarding their roommates. For many, university is a new life chapter and finding compatible roommates is a stressful challenge which can have a negative impact in emotional stability and university results.

During our campus life we saw multiple such cases, us included, in which there was no chemistry between roommates and the general feeling was low.     
## What we thought is a solution for the problem
A tailored and specialized platform designed for students which helps them in finding the right roommate. 
## Customer discovery
We identified the problem and we came up with Roommates startup idea. We calibrate this idea to people's needs by identifying our customer groups (students and people coming from the province) and validating their unmet wishes.

We then proceed to intervew a defined number of people representing those groups asking open-ended questions not only to validate that the problem is existent but also to discover and learn about new aspects which can help us identify new costumer groups.
